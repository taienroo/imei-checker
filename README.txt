I'm no longer maintaining this project. I'm also not sure whether the script is still working. 

This script allows you to communicate with Apple servers to retrieve information about Apple devices. 
You need to submit an IMEI number or a Serial number.
The script is actually coded in php but you can easily adapt it in another language, you just need a function able to decode a JSON object into an array.
